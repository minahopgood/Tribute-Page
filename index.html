				<div id="tribute-info">
				<p>Greta Celeste Gerwig, born August 4, 1983, is an American actress, screenwriter, and film director. Initially known for working on mumblecore films, she has since expanded from acting in and co-writing independent films to directing major studio films. Gerwig was included in the annual Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world in 2018.</p>
				<p>As a solo filmmaker, Gerwig has written and directed coming-of-age films Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019), and the fantasy-comedy Barbie (2023), all of which earned nominations for the Academy Award for Best Picture. For Lady Bird, she received Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, and for Little Women, she was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. Barbie, which she co-wrote with Baumbach, became the only film from a solo female director to gross over $1 billion worldwide, and earned her a second Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.</p>
